# ANZ-Virtual-Internship
## Context

This task is based on a synthesised transaction dataset containing 3 months’ worth of transactions for 100 hypothetical customers. It contains purchases, recurring transactions, and salary transactions.

The dataset is designed to simulate realistic transaction behaviours that are observed in ANZ’s real transaction data, so many of the insights you can gather from the tasks below will be genuine.

## Analysis Process
- Assessing and Cleaning the data
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data Visualization and Further Analysis
- Predict customer salary with multiple linear regression model

### Task 1
Start by doing some basic checks – are there any data issues? Does the data need to be cleaned?
Gather some interesting overall insights about the data. For example -- what is the average transaction amount? How many transactions do customers make each month, on average?
### Task 2
Explore correlations between annual salary and various customer attributes (e.g. age). These attributes could be those that are readily available in the data (e.g. age) or those that you construct or derive yourself (e.g. those relating to purchasing behaviour). Visualise any interesting correlations using a scatter plot.

Build a simple regression model to predict the annual salary for each customer using the attributes you identified above
